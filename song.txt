Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Give me freedom, give me fire
Give me reason, take me higher
See the champions take the field now
Unify us, make us feel proud

In the streets our heads are lifting
As we lose our inhibition
Celebration, it surround us
Every nation, all around us

Staying forever young
Singing songs underneath the Sun
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game
And together at the end of the day
We all say

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin' flag

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin' flag

So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Give you freedom, give you fire
Give you reason, take you higher
See the champions take the field now
Unify us, make us feel proud

In the streets our heads are lifting
As we lose our inhibition
Celebration, it surround us
Every nation, all around us

Staying forever young
Singing songs underneath the Sun
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game
And together at the end of the day
We all say

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin' flag

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin' flag

So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We all say

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin' flag

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin' flag

So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag

Now wave your flag
Oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(And everybody will be singing it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(And we all will be singing it)
